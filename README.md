We Talk has been created from Chat Engine where a personalised community chat can be created with multiple users,
each user having their own username and password for login for the chat group they belong to. Chat Engine uses sockets behind 
the scenes and to operate it on react js I installed 3 dependencies from npm @ant-design/icons axios react-chat-engine. With online 
statuses, great design and functionality, icons telling you who read the message, image support, sound notifications, the ability to create multiple rooms 
this app can be very useful for formal and personal purposes where an admin can discuss new tasks with their team members . WeTalk aims to provide a comprehensive 
and customizable platform for creating modern chat applications. With its robust architecture, real-time capabilities, and focus on security, it is designed 
to meet the needs of both casual users and businesses looking to enhance their communication tools. At first, the user approaches the login page where they
enter their username and password ,if the credentials found valid then they can land to the chat page. The UI is divided into 3 vertical sections where 
the 1st section displays all the chat groups a person has created or the group they are a member of. The 2nd section displays the real time conversation
between the members . The 3rd sections shows all the online/offline members of that particular chat group. I'm looking forward to add more functionalities 
like logout, message unsend and many more in the future.

To try it out, refer: https://wetalkapplication.netlify.app/ (as right now the users and chat groups can only be created via Chat Engine so to login into 
the site, use: username: helloworld password: 12345
